:dart: The Workshop Description
---

### Title: Best Prcatices for Collaborative, Open Data Science Projects

The movement toward a clinical research culture that supports data sharing and open-source has important implications in the post-COVID era.  This workshop will provide you with the knowledge and tools necessary to apply your new skill set immediately to collaborate with other scientists in any project. In the beginning, the workshop will outline briefly how to integrate software and reports using R Markdown. It will then describe how to develop and collaborate on code with another scientist, keep code synchronised, and solve conflicts that arise from that collaboration using version control. This is crucially important when working with healthcare software, libraries, tools, and resources, and it will be an interactive, hands-on session.

### Agenda:

* Overview of the challenges in irreproducible clinical research
* Increase reproducibility and transparency with R Markdown.
     * Use python, R, SQL, JS and bash in a single R Markdown document.
     * Create pretty documents with R Markdown.
* Collaborating in research using Git/GitHub
    * What is version control?
    * Introduce yourself to Git 
    * Make an impact **today** in open source  projects

:question: Comments and Questions
---

> I changed the title, description, and few parts of the workshop. I'll focus on collaboration and how it is necessary to work with any medical analysis, then I'll go through the fundamentals of Git. is that alright?
 
**It'll be useful to have answers to these questions.**
* How many students are expected to be in the workshop and their level?
- [ ] * Am I allowed to recruit my own helpers?
* Yes, you can have your own assistants
- [ ] * I prefer zoom for an interactive workshop and am happy to use my account registered with the University of Liverpool. Zoom makes it easier to speak with the participants, and it offers screen-sharing capabilities.
* I had a quick discussion with the team and Zoom platform will be used for your workshop.
* The materials will be licensed, so it can't be live-streamed on YouTube.
- [ ] * Where are you going to advertise for the event? We still don't have a website!
* We have social media accounts in addition to the sponsors’ and the ambassadors’ who will advertise for the workshops and the datathon. 
- [ ] *  I find it hard to estimate the time without knowing if it'll be interactive or not. Interactive session tends to takes more time. **My initial estimate is 4 hours on the 24th of Feb (1:00pm to 5:pm), but it might change if we end up using Atta platform.** 
* Hopefully, it will be interactive as it's up to you to permit the video, voice, and screen sharing.
**Please free to add comments or call me/text me if you have any questions.**
