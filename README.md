# Collaborating on Open Data Science Projects

This repository generates the corresponding lesson website from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) repertoire of lessons. 

**This workshop will be delivered by Batool Almarzouq as part of Datathon workshop in Women in Data Science (WiDS2021 Saudi Arabia).**

## Overview:

This lesson will be delivered as a part of WiDS Saudi Arabia. It is a collection of materials from [the Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI)](http://education.molssi.org/python-package-best-practices/), [the software carpentries](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/), [_the turing way_](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html), [coderefinery](https://coderefinery.org/) and [many others](https://github.com/BatoolMM/Collaborating-on-Open-Data-Science-Projects/blob/gh-pages/AUTHORS) to introduce Open Science practices to data scientist with an emphasis on version control.

This lesson will provide you with the knowledge and tools necessary to apply your new skill set immediately to collaborate with other scientists in any project. In the beginning, the workshop will introduce open science practices. It will then describe how to develop and collaborate on code with another scientist, keep code synchronised, and solve conflicts that arise from that collaboration, licencing your works and making it citable.

## Contributing

We welcome all contributions to improve the lesson! The maintainer will do their best to help you if you have any
questions, concerns, or experience any difficulties along the way.

We'd like to ask you to familiarize yourself with our [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and have a look at
the [more detailed guidelines][lesson-example] on proper formatting, ways to render the lesson locally, and even
how to write new episodes.
