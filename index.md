This lesson is a part of WiDS2021 and it's a collection of materilas from the Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI) and the turing way to introduce open science practices to data scientist with an emphasis on version control.

The movement toward a clinical research culture that supports data sharing and open-source has important implications in the post-COVID era. This lesson will provide you with the knowledge and tools necessary to apply your new skill set immediately to collaborate with other scientists in any project. In the beginning, the workshop will outline some of the tools used in scientific collaborations. It will then describe how to develop and collaborate on code with another scientist, keep code synchronised, and solve conflicts that arise from that collaboration using version control. This is crucially important when working with healthcare software, libraries, tools, and resources, and it will be an interactive, hands-on session.

This lesson is under continual development, please report issues to the [workshop repository](BatoolMM/Collaborating-on-Open-Data-Science-Projects). If you see a subject you would like to contribute to, submit a pull request!
