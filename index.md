This lesson will be delivered as a part of WiDS Saudi Arabia. It is a collection of materials from [the Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI)](http://education.molssi.org/python-package-best-practices/), [the software carpentries](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/), [_the turing way_](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html), [coderefinery](https://coderefinery.org/) and [many others](https://github.com/BatoolMM/Collaborating-on-Open-Data-Science-Projects/blob/gh-pages/AUTHORS) to introduce Open Science practices to data scientist with an emphasis on version control.

This lesson will provide you with the knowledge and tools necessary to apply your new skill set immediately to collaborate with other scientists in any project. In the beginning, the workshop will introduce open science practices. It will then describe how to develop and collaborate on code with another scientist, keep code synchronised, and solve conflicts that arise from that collaboration, licencing your works and making it citable.

This lesson is under continual development, please report issues to the [workshop repository](BatoolMM/Collaborating-on-Open-Data-Science-Projects). If you see a subject you would like to contribute to, submit a pull request! The slides for the talk is available [here](https://wids2021sa.netlify.app/#1).
